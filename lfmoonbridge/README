Quickstart guide:

$ make
$ ./moonbridge example_application.lua

Hint: use bmake on GNU systems

Then connect to http://localhost:8080/

To learn more, check example_application.lua and reference.txt files. If you
experence any touble during compilation, please edit the Makefile to match
your system.


Further notes:

The moonbridge binary may be compiled with a string that gets appended
to LUA_PATH (package.path) in order to allow proper inclusion of
"moonbridge_http.lua" independent of the current working directory.
Set the MOONBR_LUA_PATH variable to a string consisting of the path
where "moonbridge_http.lua" will be installed plus "/?.lua" if you want
to use this feature, e.g.:

$ make MOONBR_LUA_PATH=/usr/local/lib/moonbridge/?.lua
